# Sentiment Analysis with RNN and CNN

This repository contains a comparative analysis of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to understand the performance characteristics of RNNs and CNNs in the context of sentiment analysis and provide guidance on model selection for similar tasks.

## Methodology

The methodology involves preprocessing the text data, training both RNN and CNN models on the preprocessed data, and evaluating their performance.

## Key Findings

The key findings indicate that both models can effectively capture the sentiment of the text, with nuanced differences in performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of movie reviews from IMDB. It contains 39,723 training samples, each labeled as either 1 or 0 representing positive and negative reviews, respectively.

## Models

Two types of deep learning models are used in this project:

1. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Particularly suited for sequence prediction problems given their ability to handle sequential data by maintaining an internal state from time-step to time-step.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Traditionally used in image processing, have been found to be effective for text-related tasks due to their ability to capture local and global patterns in data.

By comparing these two models on the same task, we hope to gain insights into their performance characteristics and provide guidance on model selection for sentiment analysis tasks.
